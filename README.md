# EdgeNodes: Network Security System

EdgeNodes is a **machine learning-based phishing detection system** that identifies malicious URLs to secure edge networks from cyber threats. Using a dataset of website and URL features, the system detects whether a given site is **legitimate or phishing**.

The project implements a modular **MLOps pipeline**, enabling automated ingestion, validation, transformation, training, evaluation, and deployment of phishing detection models. Models are tracked via **MLflow** and deployed to **AWS Cloud** for real-time inference.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![Architecture](templates/architecture.png)

The pipeline consists of: **Data Ingestion → Validation → Transformation → Training → Evaluation → Deployment** with artifact tracking and MLflow integration.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Automated Data Pipeline**: Ingests phishing dataset with URL-based features.
* **Data Validation**: Ensures schema integrity, missing value checks, and consistency.
* **Data Transformation**: Feature engineering and preprocessing for model training.
* **Model Training**: Trains ML models to classify URLs as *phishing* or *legitimate*.
* **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using precision, recall, F1, and AUC.
* **Model Registry & Tracking**: Uses **MLflow** for experiment tracking, versioning, and reproducibility.
* **Model Deployment**: Pushes validated models to **AWS Cloud (S3, ECR, EC2)** for scalable deployment.
* **Artifacts Management**: Each stage generates artifacts for traceability and reproducibility.

## 📊 Dataset

The system is trained on a **phishing website dataset** consisting of **11,055 samples** with **30 features** describing website/URL behavior.

* **Features include:**

  * `having_IP_Address`, `URL_Length`, `SSLfinal_State`, `Domain_registeration_length`, `Page_Rank`, `Google_Index`, etc.
* **Target label:**

  * `Result = -1` → Phishing website
  * `Result = 1` → Legitimate website

## 🧠 Model Performance

The best-performing model selected was:

**`RandomForestClassifier`**

| Metric        | Train Score | Test Score |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| **F1-score**  | 0.9910      | 0.9776     |
| **Precision** | 0.9887      | 0.9717     |
| **Recall**    | 0.9933      | 0.9836     |

✅ The results show strong generalization with **high recall**, making it effective at catching phishing websites without missing many.

## ▶️ Usage

1. **Configure pipeline**

   * Edit YAML configs under `configs/` (ingestion, validation, transformation, trainer, evaluation, pusher).

2. **Run pipeline**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Monitor experiments**

   * Start MLflow UI:

     ```bash
     mlflow ui
     ```
   * Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

4. **Deploy model**

   * Models are pushed to AWS (S3, ECR, EC2).
